**Glad to meet you !** :trophy: <br>
My **Github** profile potrays my journey from writing my first ***Hello world*** program in my college to the first **HTML** page to the first **Calculator App** running on my emulator to the first **Machine Learning** model I trained on my system. It has been a journey of consecutive efforts and I look forward to more *open source* projects now. Apart from [Github]()

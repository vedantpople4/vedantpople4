### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**Glad to meet you !** :trophy: <br>
My **Github** profile potrays my journey from writing my first ***Hello world*** program in my college to the first **HTML** page to the first **Calculator App** running on the emulator to the first **Machine Learning** model I trained on my system. It has been a journey of consecutive efforts and I look forward to more *open source* projects now. Apart from [Github](https://github.com/vedantpople4/)Ask for a **FIFA** game anytime. Connect with me on [Linked](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vedant-pople-b97783168/).
